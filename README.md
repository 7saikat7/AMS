I created a attendance management system using **django framework**, **ajax**,  **jquery**, **javascript**, **bootstrap**, **css** and **HTML**.
The goal of the project is to create a web app where students can login using their provided credentials and mark their attendance for the class. It uses forms and validators to stop marking attendance for the day other than today. It also enables the admin to download the attendance of the given date in CSV format.
**The attendance form is only available for users, when the admin allows it.**

## Tech Used
Python, Django, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, Javascript, Jquery, Ajax, Docker.

## Key Features
* The homepage contains the data of every student of the department.
* The subjects section contains, the subject currently active.
* A login system where users with credentials can only login and mark their attendance using the form.
* The form has custom validators which allows it to take attendance effectively.
* The form is only visible to the normal users when the admin allows it through its admin homepage, which he can access after logging in on the website, with his credentials.
* The admin can download the attendance for the day in CSV form from his homepage.
* Admin has a pause and start button which controls the availability of the attendance form for the normal users on the website.
* The project has also been **dockerized**.
